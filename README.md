# cowlangc
> cowlang interpreter/compiler written in Rust

## State
- I didn't started the making of the compile part
- Interpret just lacks some functions, the only working are mOo, moO, MOo, MoO and OOM.

## Usage

Interpreting
```bash
./cowlangc interpret <File>
```

Compiling
```bash
./cowlangc compile <File>
```
